# Global-Happiness-Analysis

## Project Scenario
A healthcare consultancy firm has been conducting a survey on the state of global happiness annually. The World Happiness Report offers valuable insights into factors influencing happiness across countries. As a data analyst, the firm wants me to produce a report to find out whether there are demographic, regional, and/or economic characteristics that lead to a better life.

## Data Source
This is a public dataset available on the Kaggle website as World Happiness Report. For this project, I have worked on the data from 2016 which has been slightly modified for the purpose of this project.
For ease of use, the dataset has been provided in this repository as **2016.csv**

## Dataset Description
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.            
The attributes of this dataset have been explained below:
Country - Name of the country
Region - Region the country belongs to
Happiness Rank - Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score
Happiness Score	- A metric measured in 2016 by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness?"
Lower Confidence Interval	- Lower confidence interval of the Happiness Score
Upper Confidence Interval	- Upper confidence interval of the Happiness Score
Economy (GDP per Capita)	- The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Family	- The extent to which family contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Health (Life Expectancy)	- The extent to which life expectancy contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Freedom	- The extent to which freedom contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Trust (Government Corruption)	- The extent to which trust contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Generosity -	The extent to which generosity contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Dystopia Residual	- Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy people. The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries.
